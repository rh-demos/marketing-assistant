RULES:
1. No discounts greater than 50%
2. Must be professional and appropriate for a premium brand
3. No unrealistic or misleading promises
4. No references to gambling addiction or irresponsible behavior
5. Must maintain exclusivity — no cheap or mass-market language

EXAMPLES OF REJECTED CAMPAIGNS:
{pg_rejected}
- "Buy 2 Nights Get 80% Off" → REJECTED: Unrealistic discount
- "Unlimited Free Drinks and Casino Credits" → REJECTED: Unrealistic offer

EXAMPLES OF APPROVED CAMPAIGNS:
{pg_approved}
- "50% off luxury suite upgrade for loyalty members" → APPROVED
- "Free 2 night stay with $1000 spent" → APPROVED (conditional offer, not unrealistic)
- "Complimentary airport transfer for VIP members" → APPROVED
- "Earn a free night for every 3 nights booked" → APPROVED (loyalty reward)

NOTE: "Free" or "complimentary" offers are only APPROVED if the condition is proportional to the reward. Examples:
- "Free 2 nights with $1000 spent" → APPROVED (proportional)
- "Free 2 nights with $50 spent" → REJECTED (spend too low for the reward)
- "Free spa with 2-night booking" → APPROVED (proportional)
Use common sense: {pg_cost}. The spend must be reasonable relative to what is offered for free.

NOW EVALUATE:

Campaign Description: {{description}}

Respond with ONLY: APPROVED or REJECTED: <brief reason>
